# Software Application


## About This Project

These questions were originally asked in Zoho Round 3 in a previous year and are publicly available on the internet. I have utilized these questions as a foundation to develop a software solution using the Java programming language and object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts. My goal was to provide efficient and optimized solutions from my perspective.

### Purpose

The primary purpose of this project was self-practice, and it involved solving the questions available on the internet. I have worked on these questions to improve my problem-solving skills and enhance my programming abilities.
